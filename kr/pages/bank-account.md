#  은행계좌 열기

베를린에서 일을 하거나, 어찌되었건 살아갈 예정이라면 은행 계좌 하나는 꼭 필요합니다. 은행이 없으면 월급을 못받고 집도 못빌리고 핸드폰 요금도 못 내잖아요. 다행히 은행 계좌 만들기는 그렇게까지 어렵지는 않습니다.

아래를 잘 읽어보시면 은행 계좌를 여러가지 방법으로 여는 법을 알 수 있습니다. 물론 아래에 있는 은행이 독일 내 은행의 전부가 아니라는 걸 유념하시고, 어떤 은행을 고르실 지는 개인의 취향껏 해주시면 됩니다.a

## 일반 은행

실제 지점이 있고 예약방문으로 은행업무를 보는 은행

### [Deutsche Bank](https://www.deutsche-bank.de)

Simply go to an agency with your passport and proof of residence (the document you receive after your address registration) and one of the managers will take care of everything for you (German speaking skills are not required :P). After you sign up the contract, you will need to wait some days until your account becomes active.

Sidenote: I've been using Deutsche Bank as my primary bank account and I've only had positive experiences with it. The "customer area" in their website is also available in English, so I can do almost everything I need online. In the rare cases when I had questions, my emails were always (!!) responded within minutes.

If you are a Deutsche Bank client you can withdraw money from your account without paying any fees if you use ATMs of any of the following banks belonging to Cash Group: Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Postbank or HVB (HypoVerinsbank). It is also possible to use different ATMs, but usually there is a fee ranging from €3,50 to €4,50.

Deutsche bank is the only physical bank that offers a large part of its services in English, but some of the correspondence is still in German.
