## Residence Registration

The residence registration (*Anmeldung*, in German) is one of the most important - and urgent - things that you must do after you arrive in Germany. Any person who moves into long-term accomodation in Berlin (i.e. renting a room or a flat) is required by law to register with the Resident's Registration Office (*Bürgeramt*) within 2 weeks of the arrival date in Germany. Despite of that, Berlin's registration offices are extremely busy, so it's normally no problem if you register a little late.

The document received immediately after your registration is really important, and without it, you won't be able to receive your salary, open a bank account, sign contracts or even apply for a Blue card/residence permit.

##### What do I need for the registration?
- Passaport (or Passaports, in case more than one person are being registered in the same address)
- Rental agreement (*Mietvertrag*)
- Registration form filled out (Anmeldungsformular).

- If you are married, bring your marriage certificate (written in English or German)

- Patience
