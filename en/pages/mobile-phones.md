# Mobile phone

The best-known telephone operators in Germany are Telekom (T-Mobile), Vodafone and O2. The easiest way to get a prepaid number is to look for one of these carriers (hint: there are thousands of stores spread out in the city) or buy a chip directly from Saturn (or similar store). The value of the sim card + activation + opening balance is usually something between € 10 and € 25.
